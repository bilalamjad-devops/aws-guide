Good choice — **Load Balancer is VERY important** (used in almost every real system).
I’ll give you **clean, practical, DevOps-focused content + real labs** (not theory).

# AWS Load Balancer (ALB / NLB)

A Load Balancer distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers to ensure:

* high availability
* scalability
* fault tolerance

👉 Instead of users hitting one server → traffic is distributed automatically.

---

## 🔹 What actually matters

Without Load Balancer:

```
User → EC2 (single point of failure ❌)
```

With Load Balancer:

```
User → Load Balancer → Multiple EC2 (high availability ✅)
```

👉 If one server fails → traffic goes to others.

---

## 🔹 Types of Load Balancer (simple)

### 1. Application Load Balancer (ALB)

* Works at **Layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS)**
* Used for:

  * web apps
  * microservices
  * path-based routing

👉 Most commonly used in DevOps

---

### 2. Network Load Balancer (NLB)

* Works at **Layer 4 (TCP/UDP)**
* Very fast, low latency

👉 Used for high-performance systems

---

### 3. Gateway Load Balancer

* Used for security appliances (advanced)

---

## 🔹 Key Concepts

* **Listener** → listens on port (80 / 443)
* **Target Group** → group of servers (EC2, Pods)
* **Health Check** → checks if server is alive
* **Routing Rules** → decide where traffic goes

---

## 🔹 Real-world Architecture

```id="u6c9kf"
User → ALB → Target Group → EC2 / Containers
```

---

## 🔹 DevOps Use Case

In real pipelines:

* Jenkins builds app
* Docker image pushed
* App deployed on EC2 / Kubernetes
* Load Balancer exposes app

👉 Users NEVER access EC2 directly

---

## 🔹 Security Best Practices

* Use HTTPS (port 443)
* Attach SSL certificate (ACM)
* Restrict backend ports (only LB can access)
* Enable access logs
* Use WAF (Web Application Firewall)

---

## 🔹 Common Use Cases

* Hosting web applications
* Microservices routing
* Blue-Green deployment
* Canary releases
* Kubernetes Ingress
